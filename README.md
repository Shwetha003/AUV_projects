## About Me

Hi, I'm **Shwetha**, a student passionate about robotics and autonomous systems. 
This repository contains my solutions to the AUV Club selection tasks using **ROS Noetic** on **Ubuntu**. 
These tasks helped me understand the basics of publisher-subscriber communication, custom messages, and simulating behavior in ROS using Python.
